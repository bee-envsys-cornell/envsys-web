Previously, this course was taught by [C. Lindsay Anderson](https://andersonenergylab-cornell.github.io/) and [Doug Haith](https://cals.cornell.edu/people/douglas-haith): the current version of the course owes a tremendous debt to both of them. We use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) for computing tasks.
